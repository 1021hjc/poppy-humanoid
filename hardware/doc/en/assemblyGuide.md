# Introduction

## The Poppy project

Poppy is an open hardware and open-source robotics project. It has been
designed to allow researchers and students to easily remove and replace
some parts of the body.

For example, different leg shapes have been tested on the Poppy Humanoid
robot to make the robot walk.

## Safety warning

The Poppy humanoid robot is built using mainly MX-28 Dynamixel
servomotors, which are pretty powerful and may be harmful to your
fingers or materials.

So be very careful and put the robot in a free space while testing your
programs.

## About this documentation

This documentation contains some help and tips to build a Poppy Humanoid
robot. It does not replace the videos made by Inria, but complete and
sometimes corrects or updates them.

It contains a bit of context about Dynamixel servomotors and how to
assemble them ([Dynamixel Hardware](dynamixel_hardware.md)) and also how to set the
right parameters for them ([Addressing Dynamixel](addressing_dynamixel.md)).

You will also find pictures of all the parts to help you name them and assembly tips and links to the
assembly videos. As there is no video for
the head assembly, this doc contains a pretty complete guide for head
assembly.

Please don’t hesitate to comment and correct this documentation on the
Poppy forum, on the [dedicated topic](https://forum.poppy-project.org/t/quickstart-assembly-and-programming-plus-some-code-examples/1228).
