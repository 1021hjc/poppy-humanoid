Poppy Humanoid
===================
Poppy is an open source platform dedicated to the conception of animated robotic creature.

![Trunk Assembled](doc/img/poppy-humanoid-github.jpg)

The first and most advanced creature is the fully 3D printed Poppy Humanoid.

## Presentation

Poppy Humanoid is an open-source and 3D printed humanoid robot. Optimized for research and education purposes, its modularity allows for a wide range of applications and experimentations.

## Build your own Poppy Humanoid

Building a complete Poppy Humanoid costs $8000-9000 with about 60% for buying the 25 Robotis Dynamixel actuators required. The full BOM is available here >> [Bill Of Material](hardware/doc/BOM.md)


Then the process to assemble a complete Poppy Humanoid takes about 7h for  handyman people. Yet the skills required are very limited and should not be a problem for anyone able to hold a screwdriver.

The assembly process is fully documented with video tutorials.

## The Poppy project history

The Poppy project is born in 2012 in the [Flowers laboratory](flowers.inria.fr) at [Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest](http://www.inria.fr/en/centre/bordeaux).
It was initiated during [Matthieu Lapeyre](github.com/matthieu-lapeyre)'s PhD Thesis surpervised by [Pierre Yves Oudeyer](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/). At the beginning, the development team was composed by Matthieu Lapeyre (mechanics & design), [Pierre Rouanet](github.com/pierre-rouanet) (software) and [Jonathan Grizou](http://jgrizou.com/) (electronics).

This project is initially a fundamental research project financed by [ERC Grant Explorer](http://erc.europa.eu/) to explore the role of embodiement and morphology properties on cognition and especially on the learning of sensori-motor tasks.
